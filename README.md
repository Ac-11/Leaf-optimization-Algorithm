# Leaf-optimization-Algorithm
Natural computing, also called Nature-based Computation Algorithms, are such methodologies of algorithms that take inspiration from nature itself, to solve a complex problem in hand that earlier took far too much time or space to be solved or was unsolvable. It led us towards a great evolution in the field of Optimization of Computing resources and time. Ant Colony Algorithm and Bee-hive are some of the few examples. This paper concerning the project talks about the use of Patterns of Leaves to decipher a Nature-based Resource Algorithm. The different essential parameters required for a plant to survive are compared to that of a Computer to perform an optimal way in which the resource of a Computer can be optimized for the betterment. The project works on the principle of modification of leaves according to changing needs/parameters to survive in the best and most optimal way.
